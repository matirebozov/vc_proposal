### Markets

We believe in emerging markets. There is potential, talent and hunger. Emerging
markets are currently experiencing fast transformations in many different
industries like banking, technology, agriculture or energy. And where there is
change, there is opportunity. And on top of it, we know that there are a number
of extremely talented individuals with great ideas, strong teams that are in
the search of a hand to grow fast or expand into other markets. It is there
where we want to be. And it is this hand that we are sure we can give, because
we know how to do it, and because it is what we are passionate about.

Our initial for the companies we will invest in is South America. Startups based
in  Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and
Venezuela are part of our scope. The region of South America shares many
interesting features that make it very attractive and yet has a large room to
grow.

### Industries

To be considered as an eligible candidate, a company needs to have a defined
plan in an industry where:

+ The team has proven expertise
+ There are advantages in starting up a business from where the company is
based
+ Large international untapped market

### Team

+ Diversity
+ Commitment
+ Passion
+ Technical Knowledge
+ Context awareness
+ Internationally minded

### Stage and tickets size

Identifying high-value opportunities in early stages has a very big advantage:
the big potential and therefore extremely high yield of a company that can
become several times what it is today.

Nevertheless, there are more risks associated in the earlier stages as well.
Neither the market or the team has been fully proved and this means that it
might be possible that the path towards profitability is never reached.

These two opposed forces make investors to choose where to put themselves based
on their risk appetite but also on their capabilities and strengths to help
companies to reduce the threats and find a quick and steady way of becoming
profitable.

In the search of leveraging our own capabilities, while not taking undesired
levels of risk we have decided to place ourselves in a Seed to Serie A rounds.
This means that the `Fund` will be having a range of tickets based on the
potential of a certain company, and its stage on the journey.

Typically, the `Fund` intends to invest no less than **250,000 USD** on a Seed
round, and up to **1,000,000 USD** on a Serie A Round
